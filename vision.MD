Vision: 
Copy the JusCollege senior trip page and make a landing page webpage for our ATO UCSB Palm Springs trip except make the following changes:
- Use old gold primary color instead of coral coral across the entire website. Azure Blue = 0x487FC0
Old gold = 0xFFAE3B

Use the nectarine font woff2 accessible at nectarinefont-ihwpim46d-joaquin-del-pegos-projects.vercel.app/public/fonts/nectarine.woff2
 instead of any other fonts. 
- Use the ATOucsb.png Logo in place of the JusCollege logo
- Instead of “LAS VEGAS  SENIOR TRIP  2026” put “ [ATO.png LOGO HERE]  PALM SPRINGS  2026“
- The main image should be mainimage.png
- Replace “Fall break, Mem…” with FRIDAY FEBRUARY 20th- 22nd  
- Replace “Your official senior sendoff..” with Join 200 of UCSB’s Finest as we takeover Palm Springs for one legendary weekend. Endless pool parties, tons of new greek life friends, and luxurious stay in Palm Springs.
- Replace “Now booking 2026” with Now booking. 
- Replace Start Planning Button with SIGN UP
-Keep “”what to expect” section header.
- First what to expect subsection should be a the mainproperty.png picture, replace “las vegas senior trip” with “ ATO Palm Springs”, replace “hotel stay” with MAIN PROPERTY, Replace “3 night stay…” with 3 days andof endless fun at our main property. 
- Second what to expect subsection should be the airbnb.png, still again replace las vegas senior trip with ATO Palm Springs and say PRIVATE AIRBNBS. Replace the body text “ENtry to exclusive” with All girls private Airbnb property so you can take a relaxing break from from the fun, just a 1 minute walk away from the main property. Includes your whole group. 
- Third what to expect subsection should be the beverages.png Photo again replace the las vegas text and the main header should say Nightly BBQ. The text should say Nightly BBQ grilled by Chef Joaquin + ALCOHOLIC DRINKS both nights Nights. Breakfast and lunch not included.
- Fourt what to expect subsection should be the entertainment.png photo replace the las vegas text and the header should say Endless Entertainment. On Property Lazy River, Waterslides, Private Theater, and Pickleball. Fun activities and lawn games during the day + fun party at night.
- And then at the bottom of the entire what to expect section instead of any following sections it just has the SIGN UP bottom again. 
- The footer will have the ATO UCSB logo. Thats it. Clean white webpage otherwise
- The Photos of JusCollege page attached below for inspiration. The photos needed already in file directory. MAXIMIZE AESTHETICS MAKE IT SO EXTREMELY AESTHETIC AS POSSIBLE. 

Who is this page for (specific persona, moment, emotional state)
This page is for freshman girls in sororities and sorority friends of the house who get invited either from a frat friend or from another girl who got invited by a frat friend to go on the UCSB ATO Palm Springs Frat date party trip. They are signing up for a trip 1 month out and want to super hyped on the trip and all the fun that happens plus make sure they get a good airbnb. 
What action you want in 30 seconds
I want them to see all the fun things about the trip, see the logistical information, and then I want them to request to book. Right now the request to book form will do nothing so just don’t make it link anywhere yet.
